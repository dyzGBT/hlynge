# How to make mods with WorkBench and the script automation.
This repository is the master for using the workbench to create mods for DAYZ
The files contained are what is needed to automate the process of writing code and building mods using the PBoProject tools that Mikero has created
The repo will be maintained as I progress with my learnings

All credit for the scripts and the setup goes to Jacob_mango, Arkensor, InclementDab and Dance Of Jesus who have been very helpfull in the process of making this work.
